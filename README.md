HeaderLocker
=====

Hate how you can edit system header files for no reason other then to make your life terrible? 

Me too...

This seems like a regression in Xcode, as I used to remember Apple locking these files and making the input view non-editable. I've filed a radar for this (which got marked as a dupe) but please feel free to dupe it [here](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6381406439604224).

This is pretty crude for right now as I'd like to provide some indication that a file is locked, but it seems to work wellenough.

Feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/brianmichel) if you have any questions/feedback/concerns. This is my first Xcode plugin, so I'm all ears.
